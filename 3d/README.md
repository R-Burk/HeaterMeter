This folder contains 3D model source code for HeaterMeter cases, and accessories. Models are generated using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), the programmers' choice of 3D modeling tools.

STL files needed for 3D printing the case can be generated using the [Thingiverse Customizer](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1700586) to create the variant of case you need for your build.

Probewrap is a spool for winding up Maverick and Thermoworks thermistor probes. To generate it properly,
OpenSCAD must be at least version 2016.
